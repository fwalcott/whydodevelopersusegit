# Why Do Developers Use GitHub? #


*When people think of web developers, they usually think of people alone on their computers typing up code. That is far from the truth. Being a developer is a collaborative endeavor. Most of your favorite websites and applications might have tens or hundreds of developers working together to keep things functioning and keep up with the ever-changing internet landscape. Here is the two main reason developers use GitHub*

***1.GitHub allows any number of programmers to work on a project at the same time.***

  _*GitHub allows any user to make a repository or folder. The repository has a master (this doesn't mean it is more or less important than the other files). Another developer can make a branch of the master and make a clone (or copy) of the master and make changes. Every person has their branch, and each branch might have several versions or a commit. A commit is a snapshot of the file that is stored. It is a record in time. This is very useful to keep track of changes in code and of what works and what doesn't. It allows your team to give each other almost instant feedback. If the changes work and the problem is solved, the branch and master are merged o become the main version of the project. Branches are a great way to divide up work in teams and still see what others are doing. It is also a fantastic way to get feedback from your team and the broader developer community (if the repositories are set to public).*

***2.GitHub Allows For Better Collaboration By Making Version Control Access to Repositories 
and Getting Feedback Easier.***

***3. GitHub Prevents Loss of Data and Gets Rid of Bugs***

  -*GitHub stores data in a file system made up of snapshots called commits. These snapshots can be stored locally (on your personal device) and on different servers in the cloud. Saving your commits in several different places prevents loss of data. If one server goes down or a file is accidentally deleted, you won't lose your data forever. This can be catastrophic, especially for a large group project with dozens of developers. GitHub also tracks bugs in the repository to make sure that those problems are not replicated in commits (different versions of a file).*

**That is why if you want to be a developer or improve your programming skills, then GitHub is a great tool so you can learn from others, stop bugs in your program, gain a more extensive skill set, and save your data from accidental loss.**
